                    <h1 class="hedher2">Our Heritage</h1>
                    <h3 class="hedher3">Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better. It <br> was true when the first Starbucks opened in 1971, and it’s just as true today.</h3><br>
                    <p class="hercont">Back then, the company was a single store in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. From just a narrow storefront, Starbucks offered some of the world’s finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees. <br> The name, inspired by Moby Dick, evoked the romance of the high seas and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.<br><br>
        
                        In 1981, Howard Schultz (Starbucks chairman, president and chief executive officer) first walked into a Starbucks store. From his first cup of Sumatra, Howard was drawn into Starbucks and joined a year later.<br><br>
                        
                        A year later, in 1983, Howard travelled to Italy and became captivated by Italian coffee bars and the romance of the coffee experience. He had a vision to bring the Italian coffeehouse tradition back <br> to the United States. A place for conversation and a sense of community. A third place between work and home. He left Starbucks for a short period of time to start his own Il Giornale coffeehouses <br> and returned in August 1987 to purchase Starbucks with the help of local investors.<br><br>
                        
                        From the beginning, Starbucks set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee and the rich tradition, but that also brought a feeling of connection.<br><br>
                        
                        Our mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighbourhood at a time.<br><br>
                        
                        Today, with store in more than 75 markets, Starbucks is the premier roaster and retailer of speciality coffee in the world. And with every cup, we strive to bring both our heritage and an <br> exceptional experience to life.</p>

                        <h5>Starbucks</h5><br>
                        <p class="coffeecont">The history of coffee is rich with legend and intrigue. Coffee has grown to be one of the world’s most traded agricultural commodities and is a favorite beverage, celebrated and enjoyed across cultures and continents.<br><br>
            
                            And it all began long ago, circa AD 800–900, with an Ethiopian goat herder, Kaldi, who noticed his goats became energetic after eating berries of a certain shrub. Curious, he tried one himself and noticed it had a similar effect. A monk who came across Kaldi and his dancing goats grew intrigued and picked some berries from the same shrub. He crushed them into a powder and added boiling water (this may have been the first-ever cup of coffee). Upon tasting the concoction and realizing it released energy, he rushed back to his monastery to share his findings.<br><br>
                            
                            The monks hailed the discovery as a “gift from the Lord,” for now they would be able to stay awake during their long prayers. Starbucks became part of coffee’s rich history in 1971, opening its first store in Seattle’s Pike Place Market.</p>

                        <h2>Farmer Support</h2>
                        <p>Supporting Farmers and Their Communities</p><br><br>
                        <h1>Supporting Farmers and Their Communities</h1>
                        <h3>Responsibly grown, ethically traded coffee means working with farmers to produce coffee in ways that help provide benefits to their business, their communities and the environment.
                        </h3><br><br>
                        <p>We know our long-term success is linked to the success of the thousands of farmers who grow our coffee. That’s why we work on-the-ground with farmers to help improve coffee quality and invest in loan programmes for coffee-growing communities. It's not just the right thing to do, it’s the right thing to do for our business. By helping to sustain coffee farmers and strengthen their communities, we will ensure a healthy supply of high-quality coffee for the future.</p><br><br>
                        <h3>Our Goal</h3><br>
                        <p>We plan to increase our farmer loan commitment to $20 million by 2015 and provide farmers with incentives to reduce the environmental impact of coffee production.</p><br><br>
                        <h1>What We've Been Doing</h1><br>
                        <h5>Support Centres</h5>
                        <p>Starbucks has established Farmer Support Centres in Costa Rica and Rwanda to provide local farmers with resources and expertise to help lower the cost of production, reduce fungus infections, improve coffee quality and increase the production of premium coffee.</p><br><br>
                        <h5>Loan Programmes</h5>
                        <p>During the growing and harvest cycles, many coffee farmers dip into their modest reserves to cover expenses until they can sell their crops. Some farmers may even experience a cash shortage, prompting them to sell their crops early – and for less – to local buyers.
        
                            Starbucks provides funding to organisations that make loans to coffee growers, which will help them sell their crops at the best time to get the right price. The loans also help farmers to invest in their farms and make capital improvements. Over the years, we’ve committed over $15 million to a variety of farmer loan funds.</p>

                        <h1>Coffee Sourcing</h1>
                        <h5>Responsibly Grown Coffee</h5><br><br>
                        <p>Over the last decade, Conservation International has helped us develop buying guidelines that address our principles for ethical sourcing. Called Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E.) Practices, these guidelines help our farmers grow coffee in a way that’s better for both people and the planet. C.A.F.E. Practices is a comprehensive set of measurable standards focused on the following four areas:</p><br>
                        <h5>Product Quality (requirement):</h5>
                        <p>All coffee must meet Starbucks standards of high quality.</p><br><br>
                        <h5>Economic Accountability (requirement):</h5>
                        <p>Transparency is required. Suppliers must submit evidence of payments made throughout the coffee supply chain to demonstrate how much of the price Starbucks pays for green (unroasted) coffee gets to the farmer.</p><br>
                        <h5>Social Responsibility (evaluated by third-party verifiers):</h5>
                        <p>Measures in place that concern safe, fair and humane working conditions. These include protecting the rights of workers and providing adequate living conditions. Compliance with the indicators for minimum-wage requirements and addressing child labour/forced labour and discrimination is mandatory.</p><br>
                        <h5>Environmental Leadership (evaluated by third-party verifiers):</h5>
                        <p>Measures in place to manage waste, protect water quality, conserve water and energy, preserve biodiversity and reduce agrochemical use.</p><br><br>
                        <h1>Our Goal</h1>
                        <p>We aim to have 100% of our coffee certified or verified by an independent third party.</p><br><br>
                        <h1>What We've Been Doing</h1>
                        <p>Starbucks bought 367 million pounds (167 million kilograms) of coffee in the 2009 financial year. Eighty-one per cent of that – 299 million pounds (136 million kilograms) worth – from C.A.F.E. Practices approved suppliers. We paid an average of $1.47 per pound (0.5 kilograms) for green coffee in the 2009 financial year.</p><br><br>
                        <h5>Fair Trade for a better quality of life</h5>
                        <p>Fair Trade Certified™ coffee empowers small-scale farmers organised in cooperatives to invest in their farms and communities, protect the environment and develop the business skills necessary to compete in the global marketplace.
        
                            Starbucks began purchasing Fair Trade Certified™ coffee in 2000, helping grow the market for Fair Trade Certified coffee in the US. And in 2009, we increased our purchases to 40 million pounds (18 million kilograms) – making us one of the largest purchasers of Fair Trade Certified™ coffee in the world.</p>
